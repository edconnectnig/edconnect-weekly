              <li><b>Name:</b> The Growth and Characterization of CdS Thinfilm by Solution Technique</li>
              <li><b>Description:</b> Successful growth of cadmium I1 sulphide (CdS)thin film on glass substrate, using Tioethanolamine (TEA) as canplexing agent, cadmium acetate (Cd(CH3COO)2. ZH20 1,ANiionle solution (NH3), and Thiourea (SC(NH2l2) at a pH of ll*. shown that CdS cannot grow in acid medi~~rn. Also successfully characterized CdS thin film with a view of optimizing the growth parameters. Absorbance measurements revealed a CdS handgap of 2.43eV. Thickness of the films were measured and an optimum thickness of 15.6 x IO*? was obtained at the 6 hours of deposition time, uslng Sml of 7.45M TEA and 1Oml in Cd(CH3COO)2.2H20. 1OmlSC(NH2)2.</li>

            <h4>Reliability Reasoning over Vague Ontologies using Fuzzy Soft Set Theory</h4>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Name:</b> Reliability Reasoning over Vague Ontologies using Fuzzy Soft Set Theory</li>
              <li><b>Description:</b> Ontology is an explicit representation of conceptualizations, which is widely used in modelling real world domains by defining their shared vocabularies such that they can be understood by both human and machines for the purpose of information sharing. Description Logic (DL) is a knowledge representation language that is widely used in building ontologies as well as providing the foundation in which modern web ontologies languages such as OWL are built upon. Classical ontology definitions contain concepts and relations that describe asserted facts about the real world. Earlier studies on ontologies overlooked the representation of uncertainty in their formalizations. However, for a real world domain to be fully modelled, its uncertain aspects must be reflected and appropriately represented. This work propose a satisfiability reasoning algorithm based on fuzzy soft set theory in order to reason about the uncertain aspect of an ontology of vague domain. The proposed algorithm was evaluated by applying it on some vague ontologies and the result was compared with the tableaux based and the soft set ontology reasoning techniques. The obtained result shows that, the proposed algorithm is satisfiable when fuzzy concepts and assertions are involved in an ontology representation while such fuzzy conceptions are not handled by both tableaux based and soft set ontology procedures.</li>

            <h4>The Role of Internal Control as the Foundation of Quality Management</h4>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Name:</b> The Role of Internal Control as the Foundation of Quality Management</li>
              <li><b>Description:</b> This is a descriptive and an analytical study designed to evaluate the role of internal control in an organization so as to see whether, or otherwise, it is the bedrock of quality management. The entire work is chronicled into five chapters with each addressing an important segment of the research work. The objectives of the study are to identify and evaluate: the importance of Internal Control System in the management of an organization using Broadcast Media in Nigeria for the study; the features of a good Internal Control System; the factors responsible for increase of frauds, embezzlements or misappropriations of funds/assets in the modern day Nigeria; and also to find out why some of them remain undetected for a good number of years whereas the books of accounts of the organization are often being examined by her internal and external auditors.</li>
